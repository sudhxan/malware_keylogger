This program is designed in such a way that it registers and records all the keystrikes. This malware acts as a remote keylogger by sending all the keystrikes
to a particular email account. This program is build using the principles of recursions and object oriented programming. Basically, the logger.exe file establishes
a backdoor that detects all the keystrikes in the target computer and sends email to the person who has gained access.
